Code Rules:

1. 2 spaces – for indentation
2. Single quotes for strings – except to avoid escaping
3. No unused variables – this one catches tons of bugs!
4. No semicolons – It's fine. Really!
5. Never start a line with (, [, or ` This is the only gotcha with omitting semicolons – automatically checked for you!
6. Space after keywords if (condition) { ... }
7. Space after function name function name (arg) { ... }
8. Always use === instead of == – but obj == null is allowed to check null || undefined.
9. Always handle the node.js err function parameter
10. Variable and method names should be camelCase
11. Methods should be no more than 10 lines most allowed 8
12. If and else should have 5 lines of code 
12 (II). he ternary operator can be used in most cases of simple if and else
Happy Coding :-)
